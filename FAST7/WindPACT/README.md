FAT files and documentation for WindPACT reference turbines

Summary
-------
The WindPACT studies were a series of studies conducted in the early
2000s by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to
investigate technological advances that could lead to a reduced cost
of energy. Once of the studies was a rotor scaling study that 
created four different wind turbine baseline models: 750 kW, 1.5 MW,
3.0 MW, and 5.0 MW. These reference models have been recreated in 
FAST v7 using original design files from the FAST_AD input files
originally created for the project. 

This directory contains the design files, model documentation, and
FAST v7 template files.
