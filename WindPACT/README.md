Files and documentation for WindPACT reference models

Summary
-------
The WindPACT models were a set of reference wind turbine
models that were made as part of a scaling study in the 
early 2000s [1]. A project is currently underway to 
implement these models in FAST v7 and v8 so that researchers
may use the models.

Directory Contents
------------------
The directory currently contains 1) Excel design files that 
contain the original design calculations from the WindPACT
study that were used to calculate the FAST parameters,
and 2) FAST v7 and v8 input files for the four reference 
models, and 3) modal analysis results from Modes v2.22.
