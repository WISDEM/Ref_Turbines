Files and documentation for WindPACT reference models

Summary
-------
The WindPACT models were a set of reference wind turbine
models that were made as part of a scaling study in the 
early 2000s [1]. A project is currently underway to 
implement these models in FAST v7 and v8 so that researchers
may use the models.

Directory Contents
------------------
The directory currently contains Excel design files that 
contain the original design calculations from the WindPACT
study that were used to calculate the FAST 7 parameters.
